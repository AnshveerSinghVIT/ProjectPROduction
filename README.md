## Description

This project is a [Your Project Name], a web-based tool built to manage and monitor progress on course subjects or topics. It allows users to input their syllabus structure (e.g., by course, module, and topic) and mark each item as "Completed," "In Progress," or "Not Started." A visual progress bar provides an immediate overview of how much of the syllabus has been covered.

This tool is perfect for students managing multiple courses or for anyone self-studying who needs a clear way to organize their learning path.

## Key Features

* **Course Management:** Add, edit, and delete multiple courses.
* **Topic Tracking:** Add topics or modules for each course.
* **Status Updates:** Easily update the status of each topic (e.g., Completed, In Progress, Not Started).
* **Visual Progress:** View a dynamic progress bar for each course to see completion at a glance.
* **Responsive UI:** A clean and simple user interface that works on both desktop and mobile.
* **Database Persistence:** All your courses and progress are saved in a database.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Database:** SQLite (or specify: PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
* **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (if used)

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file first using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your dependencies like Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, etc.)*

4.  **Initialize the database (if applicable):**
    *(Describe any steps needed to set up the database, e.g., running migrations or an init script)*
    ```sh
    # Example for Flask-Migrate
    # flask db init
    # flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
    # flask db upgrade

    # Example for a simple app.py with SQLAlchemy
    # python
    # >>> from app import db, app
    # >>> with app.app_context():
    # ...   db.create_all()
    # >>> exit()
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application locally:

```sh
# For Flask
flask run

# Or
python app.py
